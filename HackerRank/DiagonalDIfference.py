'''
Given a square matrix of size , calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, . The next  lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing space-separated integers describing the columns.

Constraints

Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.

Sample Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
Sample Output

15
Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

11
   5
     -12
Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

     4
   5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

#primary = 3+6+5
#secondary= 5+6+2
#3 4 5
#5 6 7
#2 3 5
